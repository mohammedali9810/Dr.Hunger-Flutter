Dr. Hunger is mobile(flutter) application that uses machine learning and convolutional neural networks to recommend meals to the users based on their preferences, medical status and fitness goals.
It was built with the intention of helping people to answer the never-ending question "What are we going to eat today?". It should also help the users to design a meal plan that fits their fitness goals, whether it is for gaining or losing weight, or just maintaining a healthy shape. It should also give the users some hints about which meals they can make with the ingredients available in their kitchen.

This is a beta version of the application with limited functionality due to some time and health constraints. We are rebuilding the application from scratch a refreshed design with the help of some new team members. We will add a link to the new repository once the application is fully functional and ready for release.
